# Simulink C-API Library
<i> Easy access to States, Parameters and Signals</i>

<b> Work in Progress</b>

## Examples
### Blockparameters
```C++
db::simulink::BlockParameters bp { MMI };

// retrieve a reference
auto& Gain = bp.get<double>("Controller/Discrete-Time Integrator/gainval");
Gain = 24.2;

// or write directly
bp.get<double>("Controller/Discrete-Time Integrator/gainval") = 13.4;
```

### More Elements
The same approach can be used for other C-API Elements.
```C++
db::simulink::ModelParameters mp { MMI };
db::simulink::BlockParameters bp { MMI };
db::simulink::States states { MMI };
db::simulink::Signals sigs { MMI };
```

Internally these are defined as follows:
```C++
using BlockParameters = CapiAccessor<rtwCAPI_BlockParameters>;
using ModelParameters = CapiAccessor<rtwCAPI_ModelParameters>;
using States = CapiAccessor<rtwCAPI_States>;
using Signals = CapiAccessor<rtwCAPI_Signals>;
```

## Runtime type checking
Runtime type checking is supported. It can be enabled by `#define ENABLE_RUNTIME_TYPE_CHECKING`.
Using the wrong type leads to an exception being thrown.

Runtime type checking requires [cleantype](https://github.com/pthom/cleantype).
Make sure its in your include path.
```C++
db::simulink::BlockParameters bp { MMI };

// double is ok...
bp.get<double>("Controller/Discrete-Time Integrator/gainval") = 13.4;

// but float is not
bp.get<float>("Controller/Discrete-Time Integrator/gainval") = 13.4;
```
```console
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  Type mismatch (double vs. float)
```

## TODO
- [x] Basic scalar access is working.
- [ ] Allow access to non-scalars.
- [ ] Check feasibility of `std::optional<>`
- [x] Add runtime type checking through introspection using [cleantype](https://github.com/pthom/cleantype)
- [ ] Write CMake script to easily add generated sources to build.
- [ ] Check if referenced models cause problems.
- [ ] Add CMake interface target.

## Ideas
- change `bp.get<>()` to `bp.ref<>`
- introduce `bp.ptr<>`
- somehow allow non-scalars to be returned as `std::array<>`
